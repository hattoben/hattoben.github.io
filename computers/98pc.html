<H4>The Hardware</H4>

<P>I bought the base for this computer from Facebook Marketplace.
Originally, it had an MSI Socket A motherboard with an Athlon
XP 3200+ CPU and an Nvidia GeForce 2 GTS GPU. </P>

<P>Most of the hardware was fine for the Y2K build I wanted, but
a few things needed to go, namely the case and the CPU.</P>

<P>I switched the case from the black, Windows XP-era Antec case
it came in to a beige InWin case, which had the exact look I was
going for.</P>

<P>After swapping cases, I addded a SoundBlaster Audigy 2 ZS,
the best Widnows 98 sound card according to other enthusiasts
(nerds) online. Although installing the sound card required fighting
with the drivers, it is great once I got it working! I played
some Half-Life and GTA III with the EAX setting turned on, experiencing
these games' soundscapes as intended. It is really unfortunate
that this technology as gone away.</P>

<P>Next, I replaced the CPU with a 1 GHz Athlon. Although the
Athlon XP 3200+ was downclocked to 1.3 GHz, it was still not the
right part for this build. It was 3 years newer than my target
year, and it  has XP in the name. Definitely not the part to use
in a 98 system. The 1 GHz chip was perfect. Of course, I ran some
benchmarks before and after swapping out the CPU. The difference
was not really that much.</P>

<P>The motherboard is also slightly newer than my Y2K target,
but I'm willing to stick with it for convenience.</P>

<P>Finally, I added a 250 MB Zip drive to make file transfer to
my older systems easier. </P>

<P><CENTER>I love to collect and tinker with old computers, especially
Macs. In fact, this very site was created on a Power Macintosh
G3 with Mac OS 9. It is hosted with a provider that does not force
https, so it can be viewed on any device, modern or ancient!</CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER>Even though I wasn't around to experience this stuff
when it was new, I have always been fascinated by the progression
of technology, and I enjoy learning about the quirks and oddities
of old stuff.</CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="+2">Websites that work on old browesrs</FONT></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER>Technology is constantly evolving, meaning that every
device and standard eventually becomes obselete. Fortunately,
there are many people dedicated to the preservation and maintenance
of old websites and media. Below are some of my favorite sites
that both archive old websites and create new ones using old standards.
These websites still work on even the oldest browsers from the
late 1980s and early 1990s.</CENTER></P>
